# myproject

#### 07/20/2018
Recently (2 days ago) I realized that while I use webpack quite often, I do not know how to configure it myself. So, in an attempt to make better use of webpack and its degree of granularity , I decided to learn about its core concepts and how to set it up from scratch.

This project is the product of my experimentation with various webpack's feature and highly customizable configurations.
